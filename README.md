### Project Overview

This cutting-edge project leverages a modern, full-featured technology stack designed for high-performance, modular, and scalable web applications. Built on **Vue 3**, it integrates the power of **Vite** for lightning-fast build and hot module replacement (HMR), ensuring a highly efficient developer experience. The project is enriched with **TypeScript** for type safety and **Pinia** as the state management library, optimizing the handling of complex stateful components.

For enhanced user experience, we utilize **Element Plus**, a highly customizable Vue 3 UI library, and **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first, responsive design. Additionally, **Pixi.js** brings advanced 2D WebGL rendering capabilities for high-performance graphics, while **Vue Router** and **Vue I18n** ensure seamless navigation and internationalization support.

The project is blockchain-ready, incorporating **wagmi**, **ethers.js**, and **@reown/appkit** to interact seamlessly with decentralized networks, making it ideal for modern Web3 applications. **React Query** and **Vue Query** power efficient and optimized data fetching, while the combination of **Vitest** and **Vue Test Utils** ensures rigorous testing for production reliability.

### Key Technologies:
- **Vue 3**: Progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces
- **TypeScript**: Static typing for cleaner, more maintainable code
- **Vite**: Fast build tool with a focus on performance
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for fast UI development
- **Element Plus**: Feature-rich UI component library
- **Pixi.js**: 2D rendering engine for high-performance graphics
- **Pinia**: Lightweight state management for Vue
- **Web3 & Blockchain Support**: Integration with **ethers.js**, **wagmi**, and **@reown/appkit** for decentralized applications
- **Vitest**: Modern testing framework for ensuring code quality

### Running the Project

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. **Development Mode**  
   Start the development server with hot-reloading on port 3333:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Building for Production**  
   Generate an optimized production build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Preview the Production Build**  
   Serve the production build locally to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

4. **Linting**  
   Check and automatically fix code issues with ESLint:
   ```bash
   npm run lint:fix
   ```

5. **Type Checking**  
   Run TypeScript type checks without emitting files:
   ```bash
   npm run typecheck
   ```

6. **Running Tests**  
   Execute unit tests with Vitest:
   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

This projectâ€™s modular architecture and comprehensive toolchain ensure scalability and maintainability, making it an ideal solution for modern web and decentralized applications.
